**BallotBox** is an in-game mod voting utility designed for ModFest events.<br/>

Players can vote for options (usually mods) across multiple award categories using a hotkey (`'`), from the pause menu, or by running `/vote`.

**Features:**

- Server-driven voting UI - the server sends voting options, categories, and any previous vote selections.
- Data-driven vote categories.
- API-driven vote options intended for the ModFest platform API.
- Selections saved to persistent world state.
- Use `/votes` (op 4) to tally the top options for each category.
- Tracking of vote closing date (via config), and automatic vote closing.
